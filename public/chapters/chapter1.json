      "description": "You peek out your window. The street is unnaturally quiet. Streetlights flicker. A black van idles across the street, engine humming low and menacing. Your phone vibrates — no message, just a blank notification. An uneasy feeling crawls up your spine. The van's headlights blink once, then twice. Do you stay inside where it's safe, or step outside to investigate?",

      "description": "You stayed inside. Smart choice — or so you thought. Suddenly, the front door BURSTS open with a deafening crash. Splinters of wood fly across the hallway. Two masked intruders rush in, shouting harsh commands you can't understand. Heavy boots pound through the hallways. One heads upstairs. The other sweeps the living room. You have seconds to decide: stay hidden behind the sofa or make a break for the stairs?",

Pain shoots through your arm as you're slammed against the van. The door slides open. You're thrown inside onto cold metal floor. Darkness envelops you as the engine roars to life. Through muffled voices, you hear them arguing about 'the warehouse on Pier 9' and 'the other one still inside.' Your wrists are being tied. Fast.",

Suddenly, you hear footsteps upstairs. A crash. A scream. YOUR PARTNER'S SCREAM. They're being dragged down the stairs, shouting your name. The front door slams. Engine revs. Silence. You're alone.
